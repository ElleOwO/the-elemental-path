Implementation of air ability
-Created a new scene for the Spike obstacle with temporary spike assets
-Spike assets do not have collisions yet
Changes in echo.gd
-GRAVITY changed from const variable to var variable so I can change gravity 
for floating effect when pressing 'Q'
-In physics method elif statement added under jump conditional
-Gravity set to 2000 so it is heavy enough to not hit ceiling
-Velocity.y set to -900 so that it is light enough to float
Changes in main.gd
-variable to preload spike_scene added
-elif statement in generate_obs method added for adding spike_scene to array
-spikes generated together in spike scene without having to call both sprites
-all that was done to generate both was making the sprites closer in scene

Implementation of water ability
-created a new scene for fire obstacle, hardcoded fire location because animated sprite2d is difficult to find dimensions
-added water sound affects and air sound affects
