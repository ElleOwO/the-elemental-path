small modifications to rock pillar
Added all files from main, and added my fixes
pulled diefers branch
added control ui
added an fps cap but stull cant get it to increase gradually
buttons for wasd
changes to gem sound
This is a test on my end, but I've limited the fps capacity on my computer to simulate what it may be for other computers. It works fairly well under 60fps by changing the start_speed
Made minor changes, namely jump velocities in controls. And also some sprite and hitbox changes
changed spike color
Added gem pickups.
New spike changes and jump changes
Testing a bunch of changes with the obstacles and attacks for the overall playability
Updated with new files from group. Started working on fixing bugs, and on my end have changed the controls to see if it can make for better game play
Added menu button optiom right after gameover scene.

hid return button

test
Merge branch 'diefer' into menu-run-scene
unhid startlabel for now
hid start and return label
Making a few extra tweaks, mainly playability and sprite sizing
Implemented a glide for the air power, and a double jump, but double jump was used as a test and can be added back later
Finally was able to implement the function where if the player hits a fire or spike, it's instant death
Testing out a lot of ideas to have different outcomes for different obstacles. Finding the signals to indicate if the player hit the obstacle was odd at first, but found that obstacles find signals best when it's body_entered
Made changes to many files. Namely removing redundant and repretitive functions in echo.gd, removed the previous indication of rock obstacle, and updated the main.gd
Made changes to the lines of code. Since there were so many repetitions of code/looking the exact same. I made it all into one function. The previous iterations of the functions are still there, just made them obsolete
implemented all new changes to file. Up to date with the rest of the group
Adding in new elements to seperate zip file, will incoporate on the main file path
turned on label visibility
made thhe game run the menu scene as the first thing that shows up for the player

Made many changes. Player is now able to collide to the vine obstacle and the fire slash works properly now. Fire ability has been changed to be apart of the echo script instead. Will be removing any indications of slash.gd soon. Also changes made for the rock obstacle. Rock had to be changed since the previous obstacles were not deleting properly after being removed

Added a platform obstacle that echo can jump over or stay under. The plan with this is to have some obstacles form under or over the platform at times to trick players. Also fixed a few sprite changes. Temporarily reverted the vine back to Area2D until I can figure out how to make the vine stop the player

Testing out to see vine as a StaticBody2D. It behaves as it should as an obstacle, but now it won't dissapear if it's hit with a fire slash

Still working on the collision for echo and vines. The collision does hit as stated in the debug lines. But need to figure out how to stop the character from running until the end of screen

After many trials and errors, I have created the vine obstacle and the fire move can now hit it. Vine has been changed from a StaticBody2D to Area2D as it worked best and it detected collision a little better. There might be a better way to go with it, but we'll have to make changes after.

Fireballs are now spawning and shooting, but it's slower than player and there's no collision happening.
